# MP3MD

## Introduction 

MP3MD is an MP3 'sanity checker', which runs a series of pre-defined (but customisable) checks against 
an MP3 collection. This can be used by the anal-retentive (like the author) to ensure that their MP3
collection is consistently tagged to a high quality.

Where possible, fixes can be automatically applied, so you don't even have to tidy things up yourself!

### Examples 

Some examples of some rules that can be enforced:

* no extraneous tags (for example, remove all the rights-enforcement tags associated with MP3s 
purchased from Amazon or eMusic)
* certain tags must be consistently applied (so, for example, all MP3s in a given directory 
have the exact same 'TALB' (Album name) or 'TCON' (genre))
* ensure that every MP3 has an embedded artwork (APIC) tag
